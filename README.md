# Voice-Assistant-with-OpenAI-s-GPT-3-and-IBM-Watson
Introduction
Welcome to this project on creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. Building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.

OpenAI
OpenAI is a research organization that aims to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. One of their key projects is GPT-3, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. I will be using GPT-3 in our assistant to allow it to understand and respond to a wide range of user inputs.

IBM Watson speech libraries for embed
IBM Watson® Speech Libraries for Embed are a set of containerized text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries designed to offer our IBM partners greater flexibility to infuse the best of IBM Research® technology into their solutions. Now available as embeddable AI, partners gain greater capabilities to build voice transcription and voice synthesis applications more quickly and deploy them in any hybrid multi-cloud environment. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.

Voice assistants
A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.

Python (Flask)
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in web development and data science. Flask is a web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. We will be using Python and Flask to build the backend of our voice assistant. Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in projects like ours.

HTML - CSS - Javascript
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Javascript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive front end for our assistant. Users will be able to interact with the voice assistant through a web interface that's built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
server.py

This code is setting up a basic Flask web application to handle speech-to-text and text-to-speech requests using some backend worker functions.

It imports the necessary libraries - Flask for the web server, CORS to enable cross-origin requests, json for encoding responses, and the worker module which contains functions for processing the requests.

It defines a Flask app and enables CORS for all origins on all routes.

The index route just renders a template.

The /speech-to-text route is stubbed out - it will need to call the speech_to_text function from the worker and return the response.

The /process-message route handles a POST request, calls the openai_process_message function to process the message, and returns a JSON response with the results.

It is running the Flask app on port 8000, binding to all network interfaces.
